// ðŸ”‘ Core Concept: use Brings a Path into Scope
// Think of use as creating a shortcut or alias for a longer module path â€” just like adding a symlink or shortcut on your desktop to a deep folder. Instead of writing the full path every time, you use a shorter name within a specific scope.

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    add_to_waitlist(); // But where is it from? ðŸ¤·
    // ðŸ§  Why it's unidiomatic for functions? It hides context. Readers canâ€™t tell the origin of add_to_waitlist.
}
fn main() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist(); // Clear and Idiomatic
    // // ðŸ§  Why idiomatic? Because hosting::add_to_waitlist() makes it clear that the function lives in the hosting module â€” this improves readability.
